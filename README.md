# Smart Security System (3S)
This is the Final Project work in Turin Polytechnic University in Tashkent by Nursultan Malikov and Otabek Davronbekov.

## Project overview
Smart Security System 3S is a custom and feasible approach to introduce security appliance at home and businesses. 3S is meant to have facial identification through camera setup which sends to the Telegram a photo of a person willing to get access triggering the system by pressing a pushbutton. Also, there are two more options to grant access to a person: one is using RFID, the other is by fingerprint scanning. In addition, the system allows to know ambient temperature and relative humidity by showing details on a display and lets administrators monitor hourly, daily or monthly temperature and humidity changes graphically on web API.
